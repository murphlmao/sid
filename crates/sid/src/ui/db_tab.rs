//! Database tab: connection picker (W3), add/edit form (W4), SQL editor + results (W5).
//!
//! [`DbTabState`] is a sibling cache to [`AppState`]'s host list — a composed
//! [`DbConnection`] list for the active scope, refreshed on the same events (scope
//! switch, form submit). The render/mutation methods live in a *second* `impl AppState`
//! block here rather than in `app.rs`, so the SSH track (editing `app.rs`/`session.rs`
//! concurrently, per Plan 3C) only ever sees a one-field, one-match-arm diff there; this
//! module reaches back into `AppState`'s `pub(crate)` fields (`store`, `secrets`, `scope`,
//! `filters`, `scopes`, `error`) to do it. See `app.rs`'s module doc comment for the
//! host-tab equivalent this mirrors.
//!
//! W5 (SQL editor + results) reuses `session::ssh_runtime()` — the process-lifetime
//! Tokio runtime the SSH track already built. It isn't SSH-specific in mechanism (just
//! named for its original purpose): `tokio-postgres`/`rusqlite` both need an ambient
//! Tokio context the same way `russh` does, and standing up a second runtime just for
//! this tab would be pure duplication. `session::ssh_runtime` is `pub(crate)`, so no
//! visibility change to `session.rs` (off-limits this slice) was needed.
